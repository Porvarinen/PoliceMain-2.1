PoliceP-2.1
this is my updated version of Police_main and this has all objects fixed/changed. 
(There is 3 versions of my map so you can chose *COMING SOON*)
Install:
step 1. open PoliceP2.1.7z file.
step 2. move PoliceP2.1 folder to your server resources.
step 3. open server.cfg
step 4. write: start PoliceP2.1
enjoy!
(XML is included but read Licenses!)
remember that this can lower your severs FPS if you have already lots of plugins installed
